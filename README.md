Project **CEEMDAN_cpp**  is an imitation of [that in MATLAB](https://github.com/macolominas/CEEMDAN), but writtern in C++.


The current is an improved version, introduced in:

[1] Colominas MA, Schlotthauer G, Torres ME. "Improve complete ensemble EMD: A suitable tool for biomedical signal processing" Biomedical Signal Processing and Control vol. 14 pp. 19-29 (2014)

The CEEMDAN algorithm was first introduced at ICASSP 2011, Prague, Czech Republic

The authors will be thankful if the users of this code reference the work where the algorithm was first presented:
